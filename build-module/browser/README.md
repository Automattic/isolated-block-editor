# Plain Text Editor

This uses the `IsolatedBlockEditor` to provide a Gutenberg replacement for a `textarea`. Content is loaded from the `textarea` on initialisation, and saved to the `textarea` during editing.

If the `textarea` is part of a `form` then it could be submitted back to the server.

Multiple editor instances can be created.

Gutenberg is bundled into a single file, and basic styling is provided. A text HTML page will be produced.
